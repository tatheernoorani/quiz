You want to start getting more results from your content - more traffic, leads, and revenue - and Quiz Cat is the plugin to help you do this.

Here’s what Quiz Cat can do for you, and why it is the best WordPress quiz plugin.

= Create Fun, Viral Quizzes in Just a Few Minutes =
Keeping your viewers engaged does not have to be rocket science. It’s simpler than ever with Quiz Cat’s quiz builder. Simply set up your questions, answers and results, and your quiz is ready to go. Setup in minutes.

It’s easy as pie to input your quiz questions, answers and results with our HTML text editor. Quiz Cat’s drag and drop interface lets you move quiz questions and answers around to get your quiz just how you want it.

When a reader takes a fun quiz on your site, they will remember you. They won’t remember all the other “same old” blog posts they read that day. Even better, a quiz inspires each user to share their quiz results with their friends. These friends take your quiz, they share with their friends, and you get a viral stream of traffic to your site. All thanks to the few minutes it took to create a quiz with Quiz Cat.

= A Powerful Plugin that Won’t Slow Down Your Site =
Don’t sacrifice power for site speed. Unlike other lead generation tools that drain on your site speed, Quiz Cat is a fast, lightweight plugin. Set up your quizzes in the WordPress backend, and effortlessly integrate your quizzes with the post editor using shortcodes or the Quiz Cat Gutenberg block.

= Multi-Purpose Quiz Types =
Quiz Cat is the choice for every situation. Build challenging knowledge tests. Trivia quizzes to test the most dedicated superfan. Lead-scoring tests to qualify your prospects. The choice of quiz is yours.

The Premium version of Quiz Cat features even more powerful quiz types. Use Quiz Cat Premium to build personality quizzes, viral buzzfeed-style quizzes, and quizzes with weighted answers.

= Unlimited Quizzes =
Build as many quizzes and tests as you want with Quiz Cat. When you realize how powerful quizzes are for your content marketing strategy, you can double down and build as many as you want.

= Make Your Blog Posts Stand Out =
99% of blog posts today look the same. Make yourself stand out from the crowd with a fun, interactive quiz. People will remember you, and you’ll get a higher dwell time, which correlates to better SEO rankings.

= Gutenberg-Compatible =
Adding your quiz to a post with the modern WordPress post editor is simple with Quiz Cat Gutenberg blocks. Your quiz will size itself to fit your content area, allowing you to add text above and below your quiz, maximizing SEO value and engagement.

= Convenient Shortcode Publishing =
Want to add your quiz to a dedicated landing page, or insert it into a page builder like Elementor? You can display your quiz anywhere that supports shortcodes.

= Looks Great on All Devices =
Quiz Cat quizzes are fully responsive. No matter what device your readers are on, your quiz will look and function great. 

= Fully Translatable =
All text strings in Quiz Cat’s backend support translation. On the frontend, most content can be changed to fit your target audience’s language, and the few things that can’t be changed from the user interface can be changed with PHP Filters (see the “Frequently Asked Questions” tab for more).

= Extensive Support Articles =
We’ve put together an extensive collection of help articles to give you all the knowledge you need to get your quiz up and running in minutes. Check out the Quiz Cat knowledge base [here.](https://fatcatapps.com/article-categories/quiz-cat/)

    $array['no_quiz_found'] = "Can't find that quiz!";
    $array['correct'] = "You're doing it!";
    $array['wrong'] = "Epic Fail!";
    $array['your_answer'] = "You said:";
    $array['correct_answer'] = "Correct is this:";
    $array['question'] = "Le Question:";
    $array['next'] = "GG GO NEXT";
    $array['you_got'] = "Your quiz score";
